# Graphite Carbon Docker Container

## Quick Start

```bash
# start graphite
docker run -d -p "2003:2003" -p "2004:2004" -p "7002:7002" -p "8000:8000" -p "80:80" --name graphite_carbon erwinnttdata/graphite_carbon
# start grafana
docker run -d -p "3000:3000" --link "graphite_carbon:graphine" --name "grafana" grafana/grafana
```

## Description

Since Graphite 1.10.0 is not yet released, the Docker image will be based
on the Git repository master branch. To make the build reproducible, the 
Whisper, Graphite and Carbon versions are fixed on the master's commit hash.

Installs Whitenoise, Whisper, Carbon, Graphine, Gunicorn and Nginx and starts
them via Supervisord. The Graphine web UI can be then accessed
on port 8000 directly or using the Nginx proxy on port 80.

The directory `/var/lib/graphite/storage/whisper` is where the database
is stored and is exported as a volume.

To serve the Graphite Web UI in a URL prefix, override the file
`/opt/graphite/webapp/graphite/local_settings.py`.

## Build

The build and deployment can be started by using the included `Makefile` 
build file.

```
# Build the Docker image.
make build
# Deploy the Docker image.
make deploy DOCKER_HUB_USER=user DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD='password'
```

To test the build locally, the included `Makefile` also have the goals
* `test-graphine`
  Starts the build Graphine image.
* `test-grafana`
  Starts Grafana that can access the Graphite API.
* `test-seyren`
  Starts Seyren that can access the Graphite API.
